# Problem Statement:
- A Financial institution in India wants to leverage Machine Learning techniques to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and take proactive steps to reduce the magnitude of exposure to default.
- Goal: The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the vehicle loan payment or not, given the recent data of all the loan transactions. This can help the institution to distinguish the future applicants who might default. For each ID in the Test Dataset, you must predict the “Default” level
Note: Please answer the below descriptive question in the Jupyter Notebook Itself. This is going to carry more weightage in the final evaluation. This is an open-ended question and you are free to come up with a detailed explanation basis the analysis, model building exercise you have carried out.
- Q) Once you have a mechanism to estimate the “level of default”, please describe how the financial institution must use that mechanism to decide whether to approve or decline the prospect for the loan they are applying for.

# Task: 
Goal: The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the vehicle loan payment or not.

# Action: 
I performed the complete Data Science lifecycle steps such as:
01 Data Cleaning.
02 Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
03 Feature Engineering.
04 Predictive Modeling.
05 Machine Learning Model Building.
06 Optimizing Algorithms.
I have performed all the above steps to tune the data & get the best Sores from the Dataset of the prediction.
I have performed various Ensemble Techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoosting etc.

# Result:
The prediction from the Machine Learning model was 39%, The name of the model was Naive Bayes model with the concept of SMOTE.
The evaluation Metrics which was used to make the prediction was f1 score among accuracy, the best f1 score was 39%.
